# Token Anonymizer

This locks tokens to players can't see the name or even that it's a token. \
The intended use is for things like statues that are going to come to life or chests that are mimics. If the players can
see it's a token then it's hard to avoid inadvertent metagaming.

This can also be used for fake walls over secret doors.

### Usage

There's a new "Anonymize" button in the token toolbar. Click it to toggle anonymization on and off. \
When anonymization is on, the token's name and outline will be hidden from players, and should be indistinguishable from
the background.

### Other

- The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidsev/owlbear-aoe)
- You can post issues there, and stuck questions / feature requests in the discussion there.
